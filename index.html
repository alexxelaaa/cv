      <h2>Work Experience</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Sales Assistant / Zara Inditex AB, Solna</strong><br />
        September 2022 – Present<br />
        In my role as a sales consultant at Zara, I demonstrated an outstanding
        ability to efficiently organize work in the warehouse and on the sales
        floor. I was primarily in charge of the children's section in the
        warehouse, and also handled the packaging and shipping of goods for
        online orders. Additionally, I managed to process up to 120 units of
        clothing per hour without hanging and up to 70 units with hanging
        (pricing) for the store, which speaks to my high productivity and
        accuracy in task execution. My work also involved storing clothing while
        adhering to quality standards and ensuring accessibility for customers
        and staff.
